Max Planck researchers are working on vaccines and drugs against the corona virus and are making forecasts on how the pandemic will develop

The current corona crisis poses enormous challenges to our society and to states worldwide. What contribution can science make to overcome this crisis? On this topic page we collect contributions from various research fields at Max Planck Institutes, all of which are related to the corona pandemic.

The focus of interest is, of course, on medical efforts to develop a vaccine, but also on currently available drugs that may be able to alleviate the severe disease progression of Covid19. However, valuable contributions also come from other scientific disciplines. These include, for example, those working on simulations of the outbreak, social science studies and, last but not least, economic analyses of how we can counteract the inevitable economic distortions.
                                                                Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. 

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.

The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.

The state government has however allowed the opening of malls, market complexes without theatres, food courts and restaurants between 9 am and 7 pm from August 5.

Maharashtra is inching towards recording 4 lakh coronavirus cases as the tally in the state rose to 3,91,440 on Tuesday with the addition of 7,717 new cases, state Health Minister Rajesh Tope said. With 282 patients succumbing to the infection, the death toll mounted to 14,165, he said. The state makes up nearly a fourth of the number of cases across India. A total of 10,333 patients were discharged in the day, taking the number of recovered cases in the state to 2,32,277 while the count of active cases dropped from 1,47,592 on Monday to 1,44,694 on Tuesday, the health minister said. A total of 19,68,559 people have been tested so far in the state.

Meanwhile, a sero-survey conducted in Mumbai showed that more than half the people, or 57 per cent, tested in slums had been exposed to and developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus as compared to only 16 per cent of those tested in residential societies.

						Mucins are a diverse and heterogeneous family of glycoproteins that comprise the bulk of mucus and the epithelial glycocalyx. Mucins are intimately involved in viral transmission. Mucin and virus laden particles can be expelled from the mouth and nose to later infect others. Viruses must also penetrate the mucus layer before cell entry and replication. The role of mucins and their molecular structure have not been well-characterized in coronavirus transmission studies. Laboratory studies predicting high rates of fomite transmission have not translated to real-world infections, and mucins may be one culprit. Here, we probed both surface and direct contact transmission scenarios for their dependence on mucins and their structure. We utilized disease-causing, bovine-derived, human coronavirus OC43. We found that bovine mucins could inhibit the infection of live cells in a concentration- and glycan-dependent manner. The effects were observed in both mock fomite and direct contact transmission experiments and were not dependent upon surface material or time-on-surface. However, the effects were abrogated by removal of the glycans or in a cross-species infection scenario where bovine mucin could not inhibit the infection of a murine coronavirus. Together, our data indicate that the mucin molecular structure plays a complex and important role in host defense.

Synopsis
Mucins are sugar-coated proteins covering wet mucosal surfaces in the body. Viruses attach to mucin sugars for adhesion and host-cell entry. Mucins inhibit coronavirus infection, dependent on sugar.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged as a serious public health threat due to their ability to cause respiratory disease, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), gastroenteritis, neurological disease, and additional diseases in humans and other animals. SARS-CoV infected more than 8000 people between 2002 and 2003, and since 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus has infected more than 1700 people. (1) Since January 2020, the devastating SARS-CoV-2 virus and its related disease COVID-19 has killed more than 4 million people worldwide. (2,3) During the course of these outbreaks, researchers have sought to understand routes and mechanisms of transmission. Respiratory viruses can spread through direct contact with bodily fluids or from an infected individual’s cough, sneeze, or vocalization that expels airborne particles from their mucus membranes. (4−8) Airborne virus can land directly on the next host’s mucus membranes or can be deposited onto a nearby surface creating a fomite object. (9) Virus can be transferred from the fomite to a new host’s mucosal tissues, and the viral replication cycle ensues. Here, we present data regarding the role that mucus proteins play in CoV infection.
